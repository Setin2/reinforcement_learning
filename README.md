Various RL projects. from uni & spare time. The repository is divided into 3 sections.

# Tabular reinforcement learning. 
Contains an implementation of an n-step tabular q-learning algorithm in a custom TicTacToe environemnt

# Deep reinforcement learning. 
Contains an agent that solves the open-ai "pendulum" and "acrobot" tasks using 3 different agents: n-step dqn, n-step deep sarsa, and n-step deep expected sarsa.

# TicTacToe.js
The same agent and environment as in the tabular q-learning implementation. This time, implemented in javascript and comes with an interface so that you can play against the agent while it learns :)

To play against the agent, just follow the link: https://setin2.github.io/reinforcement_learning/
